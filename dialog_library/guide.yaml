    Let's go over the buttons real quick.
    First, make sure to have my program focused.
    I'll take care of translating your button presses into the game
    so that when you press Up you will always go North, just as one example.
    C is your button for confirm, so any time you want to select a menu item or
    similar actions. X is your 'go back' button.
    V is your button to open the menu.
    Z is used in some rare cases as well.
    B is your Start button, but rarely used.
    S and D are like bumper buttons on a controller, rarely used.
    Those are the main buttons just like in the game, but I've got some
    extra functionality too. For example.
    If you are near to an actor, you can press A and I will approach and speak with them.
    I'll let you know when you're near someone or something.
    This will also work on objects like chests or save spheres.
    If you want to know where you are on the map, you can press O for Coordinates.
    In addition, I've got a recall system.
    While in control, press R for recall to set a recall point.
    To go back, press E for recall to go back to your recall point.
    During the game, you can press H for help.
    Oh, sorry, it seems like my functionality is still a bit limited.
    After all, I'm only a virtual intelligence, not truly artificial.
    I can only do the things my programmer has set me up to do.
    Don't worry, my programmer is still working on improving me.

help_menu: >
    Hi player, how can I help?
    Would you like to go over the controls again? Press C for controls.
    The controls in battle are different, so press B and I'll go over those controls.
    How is the game volume? Press plus or minus to change the game's volume.
    How about my own volume? Use the U and D keys to turn my voice up or down.
    When you're ready, press R to return to the game.
    You can press H to repeat these instructions.

    Let's go over the battle buttons.
    Press C to confirm the menu item currently selected.
    Press X to go back to the previous menu.
    The up and down keys will select something else on the menu.
    From the primary menu (with the attack command), you can press the right
    arrow key for the escape command.
    Also from the primary menu, the left arrow key will take you to overdrive
    when it is full for the current character.
    P will tell you who is in your active party.
    S will give you current statuses for your party.
    E will give you the enemies and their statuses.
    T will give you the upcoming turn order.
